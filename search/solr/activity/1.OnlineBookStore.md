- Display counts for each author, genre, and publication year in the search results.

### 4. Sorting
- Implement sorting options for search results based on `publication_date` and `author`.
- Allow users to toggle between ascending and descending order.

### 5. Filtering
- Provide filters on the search interface to narrow down results by publication year, author, and genre.
- Implement the ability to apply multiple filters simultaneously.

### 6. Deleting Documents
- Implement a feature for administrators to remove outdated or incorrect book entries.
