# Solr Basic Searching

Solr can be queried through various methods including REST clients, curl, Chrome POSTMAN, etc., or through native clients available for many programming languages. The Solr Admin UI provides a query builder interface via the Query tab for collections. Go to admin UI and in the sidebar you will see a Collection Selector. Click on your collection here. This will list down the options. Click on the Query option. It will show the panel where you can query the data that you have indexed.

You can also go directly via this link- http://localhost:8983/solr/#/mycollection/query (replace mycollection with the name of collection that you have created)

Click on the `Execute query` without selecting any option. This will list down all of the data that you have indexed. But in the response you will see only 10 results because by default maximum 10 rows are returned via this query. To return `n` number of rows add this parameter to the end of the url `&rows=n` to retrieve maximum `n` number of rows

## Performing Searches
### Query Parameters
- **q**: Represents the query parameter used to specify search terms.
- **rows**: Determines the number of rows (documents) to be returned in the search results.

### Combining Searches
You can search for multiple terms or phrases in a single query via `q="term1 term2 term3"`
Also you can require or allow a phrase using `+` prefix in a term and `-` prefix to disallow a term

### Example Queries
- Searching for all documents: `q=*:*`
- Searching for documents within a specific field: `q=cat:electronics`
- Searching for a multi-term phrase: `q="CAS latency"`
- Searching for documents containing *electronics* phrase and disallow *music* phrase`q="+electronics -music"`

### Fetching sorted data
We can retrieve the sorted result using `sort` parameter and giving it the field where we want to apply the sorting. Also we can apply ascending or descending order filter. To do this add a space and write `asc` for ascending order and `desc` for descending order.
Add this parameter
```bash
&sort=<Field Name>%20desc
```
`%20` represents a space in url encoding
