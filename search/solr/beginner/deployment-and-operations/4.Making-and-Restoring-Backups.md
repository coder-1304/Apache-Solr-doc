Creating and recovering backups is crucial for safeguarding your data against potential loss, and it's a smart move to have a plan in place. In Solr, there are two main methods for backing up and restoring your data, depending on how you're running Solr.

If you're using SolrCloud, you'll utilize the Collections API for managing backups and recoveries. On the other hand, if you're running Solr in standalone mode, you'll rely on the replication handler.

> When it comes to backups (and snapshots), they capture data that has been hard committed. If you're making changes with `softCommit=true`, these changes might be visible in search results but won't necessarily be included in backups. Similarly, if you commit changes with `openSearcher=false`, they'll be committed to disk and included in backups, even if they're not currently visible in search results.

# SolrCloud Backups

When you're using SolrCloud, you can make backups of your data using the Collections API. This lets you create backups across different parts of your data, called shards, and then restore them later if needed.

To do this, you need a special setup: either a shared file system that all your Solr nodes can access, or you can use HDFS.

There are four main things you can do with the backup system:

1. **BACKUP**: This makes a copy of your Solr data and settings.
2. **RESTORE**: This puts your backed-up data back into Solr, so you can use it again.
3. **LISTBACKUP**: This shows you all the backups you've made, so you can see what's available.
4. **DELETEBACKUP**: This lets you remove old backups that you don't need anymore.
