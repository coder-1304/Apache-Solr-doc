Creating and recovering backups is crucial for safeguarding your data against potential loss, and it's a smart move to have a plan in place. In Solr, there are two main methods for backing up and restoring your data, depending on how you're running Solr.

If you're using SolrCloud, you'll utilize the Collections API for managing backups and recoveries. On the other hand, if you're running Solr in standalone mode, you'll rely on the replication handler.

> When it comes to backups (and snapshots), they capture data that has been hard committed. If you're making changes with `softCommit=true`, these changes might be visible in search results but won't necessarily be included in backups. Similarly, if you commit changes with `openSearcher=false`, they'll be committed to disk and included in backups, even if they're not currently visible in search results.

# SolrCloud Backups

When you're using SolrCloud, you can make backups of your data using the Collections API. This lets you create backups across different parts of your data, called shards, and then restore them later if needed.

To do this, you need a special setup: either a shared file system that all your Solr nodes can access, or you can use HDFS.

There are four main things you can do with the backup system:

1. **BACKUP**: This makes a copy of your Solr data and settings.
2. **RESTORE**: This puts your backed-up data back into Solr, so you can use it again.
3. **LISTBACKUP**: This shows you all the backups you've made, so you can see what's available.
4. **DELETEBACKUP**: This lets you remove old backups that you don't need anymore.

## Solr Backup Collection

You can back up your Solr collections and settings to a shared filesystem, like a Network File System (NFS).

To do this, you use the following command:

```
/admin/collections?action=BACKUP&name=myBackupName&collection=myCollectionName&location=/path/to/my/shared/drive
```

Here's what the BACKUP command does:

- It copies your Solr data and settings for a specific collection.
- It takes one copy from each part of your data, called shards.
- For settings, it copies the setup that was used for the collection and some extra information.

The backup data is saved in a folder based on the name and location you provide. You can make multiple backups in the same place for the same collection. Each time you back up, it only copies the things that have changed since the last backup, so you don't end up with duplicate files.

Some important things to know:

- **collection**: This is the name of the collection you want to back up.
- **name**: This is the name you give to the backup. It must be unique.
- **location**: This is where the backup will be saved. It's required, unless you have a default location set up already.

If you're using a mounted drive, it needs to be accessible to the overseer node, which manages the backups. It's a good idea to make sure all nodes in your cluster can access the same drive, just in case.

You can also choose whether to make an incremental backup (which only saves changes) or a full "snapshot" backup. Incremental backups are usually better because they're faster and use less space.
