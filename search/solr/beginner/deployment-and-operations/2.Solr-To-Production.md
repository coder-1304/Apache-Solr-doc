# Need of servers: 

- You need 2n+1 servers to survive n faliures
- You're probably not going to run seperate hardware for ZooKeeper


**Sever resources:**
- Use SSDs if you can (disk throughput is important)
- 8 CPU cores or better


**Zookeeper:**
- in the bin/solr.in.cmd file we define list of zookeepers in the `REM set ZK_HOST=` via zookeeper hosts seperated by `,`
