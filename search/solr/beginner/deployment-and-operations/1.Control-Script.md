# Solr Control Script Reference

Solr includes a script called `bin/solr` that facilitates common operations on your Solr installation or cluster. This script allows you to start and stop Solr, manage collections or cores, interact with ZooKeeper, and check the status of Solr and configured shards.

You can locate the `bin/solr` script in the `bin/` directory of your Solr installation. It simplifies Solr management by offering straightforward commands and options to efficiently achieve various tasks.

## Starting and Stopping

### Start and Restart
The `start` command initiates Solr, while the `restart` command restarts Solr if it's already running or has been stopped.

Both commands offer options to run in SolrCloud mode, utilize an example configuration set, specify a non-default hostname or port, and connect to a local ZooKeeper ensemble.

- Start Solr: `bin/solr start [options]`
- Start command help: `bin/solr start -help`
- Restart Solr: `bin/solr restart [options]`
- Restart command help: `bin/solr restart -help`

When using the `restart` command, ensure to include all parameters initially used to start Solr. Internally, a stop request is triggered to stop Solr before restarting. If no nodes are running, the restart command skips the stop step and proceeds directly to starting Solr.
